As field linguist, who aims at useful web apps for researchers in the field and the office, I couldn't be more excited about #offlinefirst — https://twitter.com/fxru/status/398055549352550400

Offline First. Because, no, the Internet really isn't everywhere.  http://t.co/cJ4fMT1H0E — https://twitter.com/mikeloukides/status/397774819233906688

This is exactly what we do with remoteStorage.js: offline first! http://t.co/v0jvRo1XSU — https://twitter.com/remotestorage_/status/397776026551738368

Interesting idea, and an ironic screenshot to back it up - http://t.co/sNWscZuSin http://t.co/CapmVYd21p — https://twitter.com/smdly/status/397779256044167168

That's some unexpected and thought-provoking set of ideas. RT “@zeldman: Offline First! http://t.co/2tOzcJbsp2” — https://twitter.com/eugenekudashev/status/397784377222234112

Team @hoodiehq pushing an important discussion forward: Say Hello to Offline First – http://t.co/ZKckz5AyxF — https://twitter.com/kriesse/status/397814019652075520

Big Ups today to @hoodiehq pushing the web forward promoting Offline First approaches! I'm so excited. http://t.co/c7oIR4bh5L — https://twitter.com/ironfroggy/status/397829802939666433

team @hoodiehq asking the next big question: what about using web apps offline? http://t.co/Wt7HhvL5KA — https://twitter.com/electricgecko/status/397829862129664000

How fuckin cool that somebody realizes... <3 Say Hello to Offline First - http://t.co/9s4LVkdxjz — https://twitter.com/henningsprang/status/397851974026420224

"@zeldman: Offline First! http://t.co/sIuwcNj358" I agree, a complete UX should contemplate both predictable and accidental offline use. — https://twitter.com/sannicolof/status/397875106950959104

Fault-tolerant applications for the real world of intermittent connectivity http://t.co/tlfDOmb66A #mobile #UX — https://twitter.com/simonblackley/status/398023993061810176

Offline first as complementary to a mobile first strategy sounds logical but there's still much to be talked about http://t.co/PHjf03DBmS — https://twitter.com/saertus/status/398036176160190464

It's 6 years since the iPhone and most mobile apps still treat network partitions as an error state. This is quite astonishing. — https://twitter.com/jcoglan/status/398057290051231744

It's also great to see an open source project seriously considering end users, not just developers. Good work hood.ie :) https://twitter.com/jcoglan/status/398057635351506944

The UX questions are interesting. Faye has handled offline transparently almost since it launched, but sometimes the user needs to know. — https://twitter.com/jcoglan/status/398057947315449856

Related to hood.ie, I've built offline apps without it but still using CouchDB, and it's *really* good for that. — https://twitter.com/jcoglan/status/398058305089572866

It provides just about the right tools you need to implement simple sync, conflict detection and merging, and its auth system is nice. — https://twitter.com/jcoglan/status/398058546203336705

For some apps you can almost just make Couch your entire backend. — https://twitter.com/jcoglan/status/398058785362558976

Essential reading on "offline" (not strictly offline, also includes slow/patchy connectivity) by @aanand http://t.co/YjdbZyuWOZ — https://twitter.com/jcoglan/status/398060682488205312

He's right about designing for offline from the start. A protocol designed around procedural CRUD operations is hard to retrofit offline to. — https://twitter.com/jcoglan/status/398060868367175680

Mobile apps (native and web) need to adopt messaging- and sync-based protocols rather than vanilla REST, and they need to consider UX. — https://twitter.com/jcoglan/status/398061136605483009

"Couldn't fave the tweet" I don't care, push the fave when you're back online, I'm not staying at this scroll point and waiting myself. — https://twitter.com/jcoglan/status/398061397059190784

Android text messaging gets this right. "Could not send your text right now but we'll send it asap." — https://twitter.com/jcoglan/status/398061617864142848

For other things the user must be told their messages are deferred, and in some cases they must be able to cancel them. No silver bullets. — https://twitter.com/jcoglan/status/398062389263736832

e.g. have a look at a messaging or sync model, because bolting retry/cancel onto a request-based interaction model gets weird fast. — https://twitter.com/jcoglan/status/398064065131454465

CAP theorem for mobile: P is *definitely* going to happen, and frequently too. Deal with it. — https://twitter.com/jcoglan/status/398065097202868224

I hope this becomes a popular maxim - fed up of offline not working for productivity tools (not necessary for other types of apps, but Trello is a shining example of this omission making productivity apps near-useless). — https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6676516

Anecdote: after finding a small scorpion on the bathroom wall in the Honduran jungle, I had a huge compulsion to tear everything apart to make sure there's no nest. The only thing that calmed me down was access to offline, text-only Wikipedia on my Nokia n800. It was 2 a.m., slept like a baby when I found out this species was harmless. To this day, I never travel without it. (Edit: Wikipedia, not the n800 ;) — https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6676661
